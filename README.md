# Chat_Server_In_Java

This program was originally developed as an assignment for class in which we were learning how to create server connections and allow a client to communicate with the server. I've touched it up a bit to make it look nicer and commented out where you would need to make changes to use this code for a personal chat server/client experience.

To launch this program correctly, launch the server first, then the client. Then you can enjoy chatting between the server and client until one or both programs are executed.
